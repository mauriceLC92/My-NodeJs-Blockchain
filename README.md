A Private Blockchain created with JavaScript, utilizing NodeJs


# Why Create a Blockchain
This little project introduces core concepts found in Blockchain data models such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Learning outcomes include becoming familiar with blockchain data, how to make the data persist and how to validate
data in a blockchain dataset utilizing block hashes.

The same persistance library used in Bitcoin, LevelDB will be used as as the key-value database to store the blockchain dataset.
